# Effective properties of lattice-like structures

*Note: This is meant for [UTBM](https://www.utbm.fr/english/) students.*

This repository contains the material needed to perform the TD on the simulation for complex structures from CP55 UTBM course.

**Tasks:** 
1. Fill the jupyter notebook. This can be done online thanks to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thibaut-hirschler/UTBM-CP55-TDsimu1/blob/main/td1.ipynb),
2. Perform a numerical homogenization of a lattice unit cell with Abaqus and the [Micromechanics plugin](https://info.simuleon.com/blog/multiscale-modelling-of-a-concrete-steel-composite-using-the-abaqus-rve-micromechanics-plugin).
